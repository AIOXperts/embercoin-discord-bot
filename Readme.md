# EmberCoin Discord Bot

## Introduction

> A simple discord bot written in NodeJS which communicates with EmberCoin's Wallet and provides users with a fun interaction and use-case for the coin.

This bot was coded as a stripped down version of a more fuller feature Coin bot that I've been working on for Lunar. I'm releasing it to hopefully help add some fun functionality to the Ember Discord channels. Please feel free to fork it, edit it, and make it even greater!
